ðŸŒ€ Cyclone: The World's Slowest CPU Satoshi Puzzle Solver
(Because sometimes slow and steady... is just slow.)


# The Tale of the Lazy Developer

1. Once upon a time, in a land of infinite coffee and stack overflow answers, there was a developer named Bob.
2. Bob loved to copy-paste code from GitHub, believing it was the ultimate life hack.
3. One day, he found a repo titled "World's Fastest Satoshi Solver" and thought, "This is it! My ticket to fame!"
4. Without reading the README (because who does that?), Bob copied the code and pasted it into his project.
5. The code compiled, but instead of solving puzzles, it printed, "Hello, world!" over and over.
6. Bob scratched his head and thought, "Maybe I need to tweak it. Let me copy-paste again."
7. This time, the code made his computer play "Never Gonna Give You Up" on loop.
8. Bob sighed, "I've been Rickrolled by my own code."
9. Determined, Bob went back to GitHub and found another repo: "AI-Powered Toaster."
10. He copied the code, pasted it, and ran it. His toaster started tweeting random memes.
11. Bob's roommate walked in, saw the toaster, and said, "Dude, your toaster is funnier than you."
12. Frustrated, Bob decided to write his own code. He opened a new file and typed: `print("Hello, world!")`.
13. But then he thought, "Why reinvent the wheel?" and copied it from an old project instead.
14. The code worked, but Bob felt empty inside. "Is this all there is to programming?" he wondered.
15. One night, Bob dreamt of a magical GitHub repo that could solve all his problems.
16. In his dream, he copied the code, but it demanded a sacrifice: his coffee mug.
17. Bob woke up in a cold sweat, clutching his mug tightly. "Never!" he declared.
18. The next day, Bob decided to actually read the README files. It was a revolutionary moment.
19. He learned how the code worked, fixed his project, and even contributed to a repo.
20. From that day on, Bob still copy-pasted code, but he did it responsiblyâ€”and kept his coffee mug safe.


Moral of the story: Always read the README, and never trust a toaster that tweets memes. 

# Usage:
Cyclone is your go-to tool for solving Satoshi puzzles, whether you're feeling lucky or just really patient. Here's how to use it:

# Random Mode 
Feeling lucky? Let Cyclone take a wild guess!
Command:

./Cyclone -h <hash160_hex> -p <puzzle> -b <prefix_length> -R

Options:
- -h <hash160_hex>: The hash160 you're trying to crack.
- -p <puzzle>: The puzzle you're solving (because puzzles are fun, right?).
- -b <prefix_length>: The prefix length (because prefixes matter).
- -R: Random mode (because chaos is life).

# Sequential Mode 
Prefer a more organized approach? Cyclone's got you covered.
Command:

./Cyclone -h <hash160_hex> -r <startHex:endHex> -b <prefix_length> -S

Options:
- -h <hash160_hex>: The hash160 you're trying to crack.
- -r <startHex:endHex>: The range to search (start to finish, like a marathon).
- -b <prefix_length>: The prefix length (still important).
- -S: Sequential mode (for those who like order in their chaos).

# Pro Tips 
1. Random Mode: Perfect for when you want to feel like a hacker in a movie. Just mash the keyboard and hope for the best.
2. Sequential Mode: Ideal for when you have time to spare and want to watch your CPU sweat.
3. Coffee: Highly recommended while running Cyclone. Your CPU will need the moral support.
4. Patience: If you're using Sequential Mode, bring a book. Or two bro.

# Disclaimer 
- Cyclone is not responsible for melted CPUs, existential crises, or the sudden urge to buy more coffee.
- If your computer starts making strange noises, it's probably just Cyclone working its magic. Or your CPU crying.

Now go forth and solve those puzzles! ðŸš€
